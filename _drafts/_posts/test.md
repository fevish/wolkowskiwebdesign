If you are a business **of any size** _without_ an online presence, then you are missing out on opportunties to connect with your customers. 

## It's the future

It's 2018. As you are most likely aware, most people have access to the internet via a plethora of devices. Moreover, when someone wants to look up your phone number or get information on a service you offer, chances are they will default to an online search via Google or Facebook to look for you. 

The problem is if a customer has difficulty finding your business within their first few searches, it can be a significant turn off. Even worse yet, if they come across a **competitor first**, then you risk losing a potential opportunity.

## The solution?

Online Marketing! (More accurately referred to as "Inbound Marketing"). Inbound marketing is best described:

> **Inbound marketing** is a strategy that focuses on attracting customers, or leads, via company-created Internet content, thereby having potential customers come to the company rather than **marketers** vying for their attention.  
>
> \( [TechTarget SearchCRM](https://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/inbound-marketing "Inbound Marketing Description") ) 

Just a few examples of Inbound Marketing Content tactics include: 

* Website that is **functional and SEO friendly**
* Blog with quality posts
* Search Engine Optimization
* Social Media
* Email Marketing

## Inbound Marketing doesn't have to be scary

Many business owners whom I've personally dealt with often have a common trait: They don't know _how_ to market online, thus they are afraid _to_ market online.

While this is entirely understandable, let me reassure you: Inbound marketing doesn't have to be scary, nor does it have to be expensive!  

There are many companies and individuals with expertise who can help you communicate your company's message, and accurately portray your brand on a professional level.
