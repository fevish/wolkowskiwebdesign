If you are a business **of any size** _without_ an online presence, then chances are **very high** that you are missing out on opportunties to connect with your customers.

## It's the future

It's 2018. Most people have access to the internet via a plethora of devices. Moreover, when someone wants to look up your phone number or get information on a service you offer, chances are they will default to an online search via Google or Facebook.

The problem is if a customer has difficulty finding your business within their first few searches, it can be a significant turn off. Worse yet, if they come across a **competitor first**, then you risk losing potential opportunies.

## The solution? Online Marketing!

Or, more accurately referred to as "Inbound Marketing". Inbound Marketing tactics include content marketing through:

* A Website that is **functional and SEO friendly**
* A Blog with quality articles and content
* Search Engine Optimization
* Social Media
* Email Marketing

The Facebook or Twitter post you clicked to get to this blog is a form of inbound marketing content. This website and the article you are reading right now itself is inbound marketing.

> **Inbound marketing** is a strategy that focuses on attracting customers, or leads, via company-created Internet content, thereby having potential customers come to the company rather than **marketers** vying for their attention.

Inbound marketing is about creating content that connects to your clients and customer-base on a personal level in a targeted manner.

## Inbound Marketing doesn't have to be scary

Many business owners whom I've personally dealt with often have a common trait:

#### “ I don't know _how_ to market online, thus I am afraid _to_ market online. ”

While this is entirely understandable, let me reassure you: Inbound marketing doesn't have to be scary, nor does it have to be expensive!

There are many companies and individuals with expertise who can help you communicate your company's message, and accurately portray your brand on a professional level.
